        <p class="about-info">My name is Peter Filicetti. I graduated high school in June of 2018, and I have been working with HTML5, CSS3, and
            rudimentary JavaScript since the summer of 2017. My passion for computer and other various technologies comes
            primarily from my enjoyment of video games; however, after a thorough realization that I am terrible at just
            about every game out there, I figured there had to be some other way to get me in front of a computer screen
            without making a darn fool of myself.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="about-info">In my free time, I like to go to the gym (regardless of how much that shows), watch various television shows on Netflix
            and Hulu, and bake some fantastic desserts for myself and my family. I also work part-time for my father, primarily
            in the way of leftover work that he does not have the time to work on, which is where I got my start in HTML
            and CSS.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="about-info">My most noteworthy achievement (that is relevant to a professional portfolio) is a Microsoft certification from Exam
            70-480 in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I am working toward getting more certifications to register as a true
            Microsoft Certified Professional.</p>
